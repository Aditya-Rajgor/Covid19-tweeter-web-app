# Covid19-tweeter-web-app
## This repository contains all the information including source code of my web-application, it's open for everyone, Happy learning!

### This project took me about 4 days to complete, first I got an idea to scrape the tweets which mentions 'urgent', 'sos', 'emergency' and "help' from one of my fiverr client. But he wasn't clear enough what to do with that, so conversation went nowhere. Then I had the data, so I created some graphs which are given below. I posted the graph onto [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aditya-rajgor_datascience-stayhomestaysafe-indiafightscorona-activity-6790899052675379200-Sb5Z) and thought I should write article about how many people are requiring for the covid19 help.

### After posting this I saw [linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarthakrastogi_india-covid-oxygencylinder-ugcPost-6791260741539381248-U3DV), using same kind of data with really great usecase! It was a simple web-app which gives contact information of help providers. And I was like how the heck I didn't think this way. After that It took me two days to develope this amazing web-application, which is indeed better.
