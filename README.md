# Covid19-tweeter-web-app
## This repository contains all the information including source code of my web-application, it's open for everyone, Happy learning!

### This project took me about 4 days to complete, first I got an idea to scrape the tweets which mentions 'urgent', 'sos', 'emergency' and "help' from one of my fiverr client. But he wasn't clear enough what to do with that, so conversation went nowhere. Then I had the data, so I created some graphs which are given below. I posted the graph onto [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aditya-rajgor_datascience-stayhomestaysafe-indiafightscorona-activity-6790899052675379200-Sb5Z) and thought I should write article about how many people are requiring for the covid19 help.

### After posting this I saw this [linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarthakrastogi_india-covid-oxygencylinder-ugcPost-6791260741539381248-U3DV), which was using same kind of data but with really great usecase! It was a simple web-app which gives contact information of help providers. And I was like how the heck I didn't think this way. After that It took me about two days to deploy this amazing web-application, which is indeed better. 

- #### It is really accurate
- #### it has option for helpers who wants to give medical equipment to the nearer patient

- #### and has nice beautiful UI and theme

- Mailing link doesn't redircting to my mail address 
- there is a scraping limit in the api
- forgot to add video to my linkedin post
- It isn't necessary that you get attention for your effort
